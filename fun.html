        <p>Have Fun!</p>
        <p>Welcome to the Scratch fun room. Have you mastered the skills of Scratch?</p>
        <p>Don't worry if you have not yet! You can still see this page.</p>
        <p>This page is all about what you can do with Scratch.</p>
        <h2>#1: Make an animation</h2>
        <p>Yes! You can make your own animation using Scratch!</p>
        <p>It is quite easy. All you have to do is put a "repeat forever" block, and make art!</p>
        <p style="color:darkgreen">->[On FLAG clicked]<br/>[repeat forever]<br/>__[next costume]</p>
        <h2>#2: Make a platformer-style game!</h2>
        <p>this one is a little bit harder, but it can also be more fun!</p>
        <p>You can make it with your own code, or use inspiration from other people (just give them credit in the "Notes and Credits" text box.)</p>
        <p>That is all so far. Thank you for reading this!</p>
